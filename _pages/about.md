I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Stanford University. I obtained my undergraduate and Master's degree at the SÃ£o Paulo School of Economics (FGV-SP). 

My main research fields are development economics and political economy, although I am easily entertained by other topics within Economics. Currently, my research interests are divided in three topics: media markets and accountability, savings and credit decisions, and healthcare. Please email me if you want to talk.
