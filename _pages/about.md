I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Stanford University. I obtained my undergraduate and Master's degrees at the Sao Paulo School of Economics (FGV-SP).

My main research fields are development economics and political economy. I like to understand how agents react to and share information and how it determines economic and political outcomes. Currently, my research interests are divided in three topics: media markets and accountability, savings and credit, and healthcare.
