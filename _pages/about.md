I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Stanford University. I obtained my undergraduate and Master's degree at the Sao Paulo School of Economics (FGV-SP).

My main research fields are development economics and political economy. Currently, my research interests are divided in three topics: media markets and accountability, savings and credit, and healthcare, although I am easily entertained by many other topics.
